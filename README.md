### Patterns & Practices being applied

![Development Principles](/images/MVVM_architecture.png)

The pattern used in this application is MVVM (Model - View - View Model). MVVM consists of three main components :

#### Model
This class holds the data of the application. It doens't communicate directly with the View. 

#### View
This class represents the UI of the application, completely seperate from any business logic update. It observes the ViewModel.

#### ViewModel
This class acts as a link between the Model and the View. It's responsible for transforming the data from the Model, providing data to the View. Itâ€™ll also ask for the data from the Model.

Also, this application apply Android Architecture Components with the use of LiveData and ViewModel

### Code folder structure

![Code Folder Structure](/images/code_folder_structure.png)

#### builder 
This package contains Classes responsible for  

#### constants
This package contains constants values of applications. Such as URL, API Params, ...

#### data 
This package contains data related functionalities. Such as API Fetching Services and Data Repository.

####  |_ api
This package contains API Fetching Services. Including Retrofit Service Provider and Request Service Interface.

####  |_ repository
This package contains classes which act as data providers for other layers, such as View, containing business logics

#### model 
This package contains data models.

####  |_ weatherdata
This package contains WeatherData related models. Used in parsing Json objects from network repsonses.

#### ui
This package contains Activities.

####  |_ adapter
This package contains Adapter for RecyclerView.Adapter implementation.

####  |_ view
This package contains the Activities of the application.

####  |_ viewmodel
This package contains the ViewModels for each activities.

#### util
This package contains utilities functions.

### Libraries and frameworks used

#### Retrofit

Retrofit is a library for Android and Java aiming to make it easier to make network requests.

#### Coroutines

Coroutines is a library to perform asynchronous tasks efficiently.

#### LiveData

LiveData provides an observable and lifecycle-aware data holder class.

#### ViewModel

ViewModel is class that is responsible for preparing and managing data for Activity.

#### Gson

Gson is a library for serializing and deserializing Java objects to (and from) JSON.

### Required steps in order to get the application to run on a local computer

1. Android Studio Version 4.1 or higher, (you can get it via this link : https://developer.android.com/studio/preview).
2. An Android Device or An Android Emulator.
3. A copy of this directory. 
4. Open the <b>weatherforecast</b> directory using Android Studio Version 4.1
5. Waiting for Gradle to Sync then build project.
